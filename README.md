## About the project

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
They'd like a data engineer to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from Amazon S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data into S3 as a set of dimmensionnal tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
 
## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline for data stored in S3, using Spark and Hadoop tools.
* Load data from S3
* Process data using Spark into analytics tables
* Load the data results into S3

## Getting started

### Dataset

The twice datasetset reside in S3:  

* `Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* `Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

##### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
##### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. 
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### To Run

### Setup Docker

You may have Docker in your machine.
I have [Systemd](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units) as system manager and use `systemctl start docker` for example. 
I choose to work with the swarm mode to learn about Docker machine. [Getting started with swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/)

1. In a directory, clone this project from GitHub:
```sh
https://github.com/anthelix/udacity_project4.git
```
2. In mydemo, create $PWD/data/postgres directory for PostgreSQL files:   
`cd udacity_project4`  
`mkdir -p ./data/postgres`

3. Optional, for local development, install Python packages: (psycopg2-binary, #bokeh, #plotly, #chart_studio, numpy, #scipy, python-dotenv)  
`pip3 install --upgrade pip --user`  
`python3 -m pip install -r worflow/config/requirements.txt`

4. Optional, pull docker images first, it's faster.  
`systemctl start docker`  
`docker pull jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`  
`docker pull postgres:12-alpine`  
`docker pull adminer:latest`

5. Init the swarm mode and the master node by default
`docker swarm init` 

6. Deploy Docker Stack from the `udacity_project4` directory  
`docker stack deploy -c stack.yml jupyter`    
And to check : `docker stack ps jupyter --no-trunc`

7. Retrieve the token to log into Jupyter. 
`docker logs $(docker ps | grep jupyter_spark | awk '{print $NF}')`. Crl + click on the lst of tree

8. From the Jupyter terminal, run the install script:   
`sh ./config/config_jupyter.sh`

9. To stop the services:
`docker stack rm jupyter`

### Setup dl.cfg
* Enter your credentials AWS in the dl.cfg
    * please, don't write ant quote.
    ```
    [AWS]
    KEY=XXXXXXX
    SECRET=XXXXXXXXX
    ```

## Worflow

In this project, we'll collecting input data to AWS S3, data will be loaded into AWS EMR for processing and the queries results will be stored back into AWS S3 as parquet files

### Define a Star Schema

* Schema for Song Play Analysis
    * Fact Table
        * songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
            * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

* Dimension Tables
    * users - users in the app
        * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    * songs - songs in music database
        * song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    * artists - artists in music database
        * artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
    * time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        * start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### Collecting input data to AWS S3


### Process the data with spark 


### Write results tp parquet files
